## Project Description - Jose, Varun, Logan, Trevor

What is the dataset you'll be working with?  Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be.
https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/
- Data collected by progressive American magazine “Mother Jones”
-  Mark Follman, Gavin Aronsen, Deanna Pan

- Data collected by personal finance website “Wallethub”
- Persephone L Hall, Kit W Cho, Kimberly A Daubman, Kevin Gaw, Joan Gallager, Jill Koehler Chou, Jennifer Zwagerman, Bradley H Smith, Danney Rasco, Ana T Baida

Who is your target audience?  Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset.  You should hone in on one of these audiences.
- In reality, anyone. Mass shootings have become an unfortunate reality of modern day America, and can occur anywhere at any time. Thus, we want to be careful on focusing on one specific group of people, since this is a sensitive topic, and instead, raise awareness as a whole for everyone.  

What does your audience want to learn from your data?  Please list out at least 3 specific questions that your project will answer for your audience.

- Where are most of these shootings occurring in the United States? 
- Is there a connection between states that highest in terms of “happiness” in the United States and the number of shootings that occur in that state? (For example, do states that are higher in the “happiness” index have less occurrences of mass shootings)
- Are there any other commonalities or outliers that might be potential factors in these mass shootings? (State political affiliation, local economy, etc)


## Technical Description
How will you be reading in your data (i.e., are you using an API, or is it a static .csv/.json file)? 
- Our data sources mainly consists of csv files so we will be reading them in as csv files. 
What types of data-wrangling (reshaping, reformatting, etc.) will you need to do to your data?
Will most likely be filtering data based on the criteria of our project and research questions. 
Will most likely also use group by and other dplyr functions as needed,

What (major/new) libraries will be using in this project (no need to list common libraries that are used in many projects such as dplyr)
- We will be using libraries that we having using all quarter. No new additions.

What major challenges do you anticipate? 
- Finding data that best suits what we aim to answer. 
- Having meaningful results, not just one thing causes another.
